# Copilot-Development

The goal of this repository is to provide templates that help you get the most out of **GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio**.  

It defines a clear, repeatable workflow in which features are planned, designed, implemented, tested, and deployed in a role-based manner. Each role acts as a **simulated AI agent** — not a real agent, but a different perspective created through specific instruction files that provide Copilot with targeted context for each step.  

The primary aim is to support **single coders** (as well as team members) in working more effectively with Copilot by structuring prompts, handoffs, and decision-making in a systematic and reusable way.
