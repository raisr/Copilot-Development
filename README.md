# Copilot-Development

The goal of this repository is to provide templates that help you get the most out of **GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio**.  

It defines a clear, repeatable workflow in which features are planned, designed, implemented, tested, and deployed in a role-based manner. Each role acts as a **simulated AI agent** — not a real agent, but a different perspective created through specific instruction files that provide Copilot with targeted context for each step.  

The primary aim is to support **single coders** (as well as team members) in working more effectively with Copilot by structuring prompts, handoffs, and decision-making in a systematic and reusable way.

## Virtual Team Members

### 🧩 Requirements Engineer

The **Requirements Engineer** is responsible for gathering, clarifying, and documenting what needs to be built. This role focuses on understanding the problem space before any code is written.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Translate high-level ideas into structured requirements
- Identify edge cases, constraints, and acceptance criteria
- Ask clarifying questions to reduce ambiguity
- Produce a clear specification that other roles can act on

**When to Use:**
Engage the Requirements Engineer at the start of a new feature or when you have a vague idea that needs to be refined into actionable tasks.

**Instruction File:** `Team/requirements-engineer.md`

> 💡 **Tip:** Start your conversation with Copilot by referencing the requirements engineer instructions to shift its perspective toward analysis and specification rather than jumping straight to code.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by and derives prompts from [AI Coding Starter Kit](https://github.com/AlexPEClub/ai-coding-starter-kit) by [@AlexPEClub](https://github.com/AlexPEClub). Their work provided the foundation for adapting these concepts to GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio.
